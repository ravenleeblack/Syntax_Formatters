# Syntax_Formatters

These are the 2 syantax formatters I currently use for the Illeshian language and the Seedling Assembler. You will have to follow a guide on how to add extensions into vscode in order to provide these as options for you in vscode. They still need mork in order to get all of the language covered. For basic syntax for Illeshian and seedling I tend to choice earth tones for nice readability.
