# Syntax_Formatters

These are the 2 syntax formatters I currently use for the Illeshian language and the Seedling Assembler. I tried to use an earthy tone for the colors. 

1) Download the files from here.
2) Move either both the Illeshian and Seedling into C:\Users\your_folder_name\\.vscode\extensions
3) Copy the files from the vscode folder that I provided here into your projects .vscode folder. So replace the standard ones they give.
4) Refresh vscode and the syntax should be on either a .ill or .seed file now.

Example coloring for the Illeshian syntax:

![illeshian_syntax](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/25f62aff-3fec-4a66-8a6f-c8dff955bfae)

Example coloring for the Seedling syntax:

![syntax_structure](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d70e33bb-b431-42cb-b7c8-8b5de2c0a67f)

Also using the pre-files I provide will most likely change your wsl2 terminal.
In the setting.json file you can change this if you do not want to remove the code from below.
