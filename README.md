# Syntax_Formatters

These are the 2 syntax formatters I currently use for the Illeshian language and the Seedling Assembler. I try to use an earthy tone for the colors. 

1) Download the files from here.
2) Move either both the Illeshian and Seedling into C:\Users\your_folder_name\.vscode\extensions
3) Copy the files from the vscode folder into your projects .vscode folder. So replace the standard ones they give.
4) Refresh vscode and the syntax should be on either a .ill or .seed file now.

If you want to help make the formatters better feel free to reach out.
